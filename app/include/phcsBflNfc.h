 * Comment:
 *  The functios declared here are used within the C and C++ of the implementation. When used by the
 *  C variant these functions, providing already full protocol facilities, are called directly. When
 *  used within a C++ environment the functions are encapsulated by a class which provides
 *  additional features such as multi-device capabilities per application. The problem is not to
 *  link underlying C to a C++ caller, it rather appears when attempting to do it vice versa.
 *  Therefore, a "glue" class exists which is a class with a static member to be called from
 *  whithin C because of its missing implicit "this" pointer.

 *
*  The DEP_REQ function exchanges user data (payload) with the Target. It includes all functionality
*  according to the NFC specification (such as DID, NAD support, datalink functionality and error
*  handling). \n
*  When this function receives a request for timeout extension (RCLSTATUS_TARGET_SET_TOX) it exits.
*  In this case the application must get the requested value (NfcIRequestedToxValue) apply it and
*  restart the function. Then the function's behaviour is to exit, if everything goes well, a second
*  time however with status RCLSTATUS_TARGET_RESET_TOX. This shall trigger the application to apply
*  the old timeout values again with a subsequent second restart of the function. No modification of
*  the parameter must be done in the meantime.\n
*  The function also exits temporarily to indicate that the user buffer (the buffer the application
*  specifies and hands over to this function as one parameter member) is not sufficiently large for
*  all data to transfer. \n 
*  There are two cases:
*  <ul>
*  <li>
*  First, transfer form Initiator to Target: \n When the application sets the <em>NFCI_CONTINUE_CHAINING</em>
*  bit in the <em>flags</em> member of <em>dep_req_param</em> the protocol is instructed to indicate
*  "More Information" to the Target even if it is the last frame to be sent. Then the protocol stops
*  with no data return, waiting to be called again to resume transfer with the next buffer. This mechanism
*  can be called "Meta-Chaining" and enables the Initiator to send data of arbitrary length, exceeding 64K
*  or the limit of available RAM which could be much less.\n
*  </li>
*  <li>
*  Second, transfer from the Target to the Initiator: \n The application's responsibility is, among others, 
*  to provide RAM to the Initiator protocol for data return. The Target does not know how much the Initiator
*  has of that resource. If the Target returns more data than the Initiator buffer (again the user buffer) can
*  hold this function exits with <em>RCLSTATUS_USERBUFFER_OVERFLOW</em>, returning the data in the buffer.
*  Additionally the <em>NFCI_CONTINUE_CHAINING</em> bit in the <em>flags</em> member of <em>dep_req_param</em>
*  is set. The application can now save all data and resume receiving by simply calling the protocol again.
*  Please note that the <em>NFCI_CONTINUE_CHAINING</em> bit must remain set for the second (or further)
*  call(s), as long as the protocol signals this need. The transfer is finished when the bit is cleared
*  and/or the status is different than <em>RCLSTATUS_USERBUFFER_OVERFLOW</em>.\n
*  </li>
 *  </ul>
 *
 *  The "Meta-Chaining" feature becomes especially useful in a peripheral with limited RAM resources.

    /*! [in,out] Type of response to be generated by the application -
              defined endpoint. There are two groups of incoming values:
    \n\n      Administration Group:
    <ul>
    <li>      ATR_REQ:\n This value is handed over when the Target protocol receives
                    a valid ATR Request. The endpoint is responsible for retrieving
                    the values the Initiator has sent, starting with BSi. The protocol
                    removes information (header, DID) located before BSi. The byte order
                    and format is defined by the NFC specification (ATR_REQ sequence).
                    After retriving information from the Initiator the Target must fill
                    in its own values, again starting after the header and DID, with BSt.
                    The order of values is defined in the ATR Response, described by the
                    NFC specification.
                    \n The location to retrieve and fill in data is the trx_buffer member
                    of this structure. </li>
    <li>      PSL_REQ:\n The Target endpoint implementation is required to retrieve the BRS and
                    FSL values which have been sent by the Initiator. Again, the header is
                    omitted, therefore the data buffer (trx_buffer) starts with BRS.
                    \n  No information can be returned with this function.
                    \n  Internally, the protocol generates a response, still with the old parameters. </li>
    <li>      PSL_RES:\n After the protocol has generated its response to the PSL_REQ (see item above)
                    the endpoint is called again with this type of action. Since a PSL changes
                    communication parameters and the response is sent with the old values, the
                    Target must have the chance to apply the new settings, which is done in this 
                    function: The NFC Target endpoint implementation would now be required to change
                    the RF chip and communication settings to the new baudrate and frame size. This
                    function does not generate a response, no data can be returned. </li>
    <li>      DSL_REQ:\n The Target protocol has received a DSL request from the Initiator and
                    already entered deselected state. The purpose of the callback is to
                    inform the underlying application of this event. It neither provides nor
                    returns information. </li>
    <li>      WUP_REQ:\n This is the reverse operation to DSL. Also, this operation neither provides nor
                    returns information. The sole purpose is the information of the underlying
                    application.
                    \n This action is only enabled when in active mode, according to the NFC specification. </li>
    <li>      RLS_RES:\n When the protocol has already entered the released state the callback, again
                    providing and taking no information, merely informs the application of the event. </li>
    <li>      NFC_RES_NONE:\n The endpoint never receives this value from the protocol, however, if the endpoint
                    implementation (embedding system) decides to remain silent (produce no response) this
                    is the value returned to the protocol in the endpoint parameter structure. This mechanism
                    is enabled for DEP_RE* and should be used testing purposes only. In order to avoid a response
                    being sent back to the Initiator the return status of the TargetEndpointCallback method
                    shall be set to a value other than RCLSTATUS_SUCCESS.
    </ul>
            The action_type parameter needs to be left unchanged, only the return status of the
            callback can be used to indicate application-depending success or failure.

    \n\n    Communication Group
    <ul>
    <li>      NFC_DEP_REQ:\n In case that the NFC Target has been initialised to use a large buffer as an
                        application buffer the protocol performs chaining automatically. After receiving
                        a large amount of data and placing it in the buffer, the Target endpoint is called
                        in order to indicate the presence of data, sent by the Initiator. Data starts at
                        the beginning or at offset 1, depending on the content of the nad_present member.
                        \n When returning data the application must copy data into the trx_buffer. The protocol
                        performs chaining automatically. However, if the nad_preset member is TRUE, the
                        Target must also use NAD therefore the first data byte has to contain the NAD. </li>
    <li>      NFC_REQ_INF:\n When there is no large buffer specified for the Target, this valus indicates that an
                        Information Block has been received. The *mi_present member indicates wheter more
                        information is about to come. In this case the application must fill in ACK in order
                        to confirm the reception of the block. This is done by setting the action_type member
                        to NFC_RES_ACK and returning no data (trx_buffer_size = 0).
                        \n Otherwise, when the Initiator expects an Information Block (*mi_present is FALSE)
                        the application has to compose information, starting with NAD, if NAD has been used
                        by the Initiator and it is the first INF block to return. </li>
    <li>      NFC_REQ_ACK:\n When chaining is used by the Target and the Initiator has confirmad the reception of an
                        Information Block by sending an ACK frame, the Target endpoint receives this value. In this
                        case, the application must generate the next INF frame and set the action_type parameter to
                        NFC_RES_INF. </li>
    <li>      NFC_REQ_NACK:\n The application ust react according to the NFC specification, e.g by returning the last
                        INF block. </li>
    <li>      NFC_REQ_TOX:\n The Target has requested a TOX (Timeout Extension Request). A TOX can be sent instead of
                        an Information block. When this value is received the Target must continue with normal
                        operation.
                        \n When the Target sends a TOX the only byte in the trx_buffer must be the TOX value requested.
                        Moreover the Target must, in order to issue a TOX request, set the action_type member
                        to NFC_RES_TOX. </li>
    </ul>

* \param[in] *p_target_buffer       Pointer to a large user buffer, provided by the embedding software.
*                                   This buffer is used by the protocol as an information destination
*                                   when receiving and as a source when returning user data. Set to
*                                   NULL in order to disable automatic frame handling (chaining).
* \param[in]  target_buffer_size    Size of the large data buffer for application (embedding software)
*                                   use. Set to zero in order to disable automatic frame handling
*                                   (chaining).

*                                   of the Initiator upon ATR_REQ.
* \param[in] *p_nfcidt_buffer       Pre-allocated and initialised 10-byte buffer for the Target protocol
*                                   to provide the Target's NFCID-3.

*                                   operation. If zero (FALSE) the protocol selects active mode.
* \param[in] *p_upper               Pointer to the protocol's endpoint. This is a component with a defined
*                                   interface, however the implementation must be defined by the embedding
*                                   software (since it is the point where requests arrive and responses are
*                                   put together).
* \param[in] *p_lower               Pointer to a component representing the lower instance, responsible
*                                   for raw data exchange (RC-I/O component).
*
* \retval  PH_ERR_BFL_SUCCESS        Operation successful.
*
* \note The small TX/RX buffer (TRxBuffer) used for building individual frames needs not to be specified here.
*       It comes together with the Dispatch member function and must be managed by the embedding
*       software. The size of the buffer (to indicate how many bytes the Target can return) is set to the default
*       value (64). After ATR_REQ / PSL_REQ the final buffer size for the current session is fixed. In order to
*       apply the corresponding settings, call the SetTRxBufProp function.\n
*       The large buffer is for easy protocol access when there are sufficient resources. However, in a system
*       without abundant resources it may be desirable to control the Target protocol behaviour when sending and
*       receiving data. In order to disable automatic chaining (handle individual frames with the embedding software)
*       the user buffer pointer must be set to NULL and ts size to zero.
